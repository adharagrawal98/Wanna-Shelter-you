<!-- Homeless Shelter Donation Platform

Project Overview

This platform bridges donors and homeless shelters, allowing for secure and direct funding of shelter stays. It leverages PayPal APIs and QR Code technology to ensure transparency, efficiency, and trust in the donation process. A novel feature includes QR Code Receipts, acting as redeemable objects that enable shelters to claim funds directly. -->
